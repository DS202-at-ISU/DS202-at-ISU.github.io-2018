<p>Obviously, it can be assumed that many people have done similar graph analysis for stock quotes. 
      That is the main reason why I’m betting on the idea of having a specific approach: 
      explore different data sets in order to make speculations from a Long-term-trader (with no experience) point of view. 
      Essentially, analyze different outcomes from investing during a recession, and judge the idea of taking ‘a financial risk’.
      By using data for job salaries in the US, we’ll be able to simulate outcomes that may fit the future condition of any member of the audience.
      The report’s conclusion will not explicitly tell the audience what financial actions must be taken, but rather provide information for different scenarios.</p>

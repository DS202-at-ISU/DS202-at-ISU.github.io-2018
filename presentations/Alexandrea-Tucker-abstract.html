<p>This project uses a dataset concerning blue collar workers in the United States. The purpose of researching this data is to identify key factors that are related to cause unemployment of blue collar workers. The initial steps for research began with a brief exploration of the data. The exploration uncovered several problems involving cleaning the data. The main purpose of cleaning this data was to identify states. This research focuses on three main topics: reason for job loss, level of education, and age. One of the conclusions includes the relationship between age and tenure. Additionally, a relationship between gender and years of school was identified.

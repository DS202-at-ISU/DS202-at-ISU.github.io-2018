<p>Our data set contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies along with critic and user ratings. It is a combined web scrape from VGChartz  and Metacritic  along with manually entered year of release values for most games with a missing year of release. The original coding was created by Rush Kirubi</p>

<p>The exploration of this data sets out to answer several thought provoking questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do video game genres vary by console?</li>
  <li>How has the popularity of gaming genres changed throughout history?</li>
  <li>What are the top selling games each year?</li>
  <li>Do some games see more or less success based on region?</li>
  <li>What is the best selling video game of all time?</li>
  <li>What are the top games for each gaming platform?</li>
  <li>What is the lifespan of a gaming console and how many games were released throughout time?</li>
  <li>What is the market share distribution of consoles for each year?</li>
  <li>What is the relationship between critic score and platform?</li>
  <li>What impact do negative critic scores have on video game sales?</li>
</ol>

<p>The project will delve into these questions, present the findings, and discuss methodology, when applicable.</p>
